            I minify the JavaScript and the CSS files using <a href="https://github.com/madskristensen/webEssentials2015">Web Essentials tools</a> and even images using similar projects extension.

            But minifying HTML is more difficult. There are very few tools for that. Most of them integrates in the rendering pipeline. 
            They are executed just after the HTML is generated by the pages. It means they are invoked after each page request and thus they increase the CPU usage. 
            The only real solution to minify HTML while reducing CPU and bandwidth usage, is to rewrite the pages manually to remove all the useless blank characters.
